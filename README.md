> ### Installation Instructions

> 1 - In Kodi use the "File Manager" to add a new 'source' pointing to either of these sources:

>> 
>> https://m-borsch.github.io/MB-KODI-ADDONS
>
> 2 - In Kodi use the "Addons" - "Install from zip" option to install the repositories and/or addons listed below utilizing the 'source' that you added in the previous step
>
> 3 - In Kodi use the "Addons" - "Install from repo" option to install the associated 'addon' from each respective repository that you added in the previous step
>
> 4 - In Kodi you can use the "File Manager" to copy the MB-KODI-SUPPORT-FILES.zip file to your local install of Kodi
>
> 5 - In Kodi, in the "Display" section you can use the sample background file from MB-KODI-SUPPORT-FILES as a custom Kodi background
>
> 6 - In Kodi you can use the "File Manager" to overwrite the favourites.xml file in the profile directory by copying the file from MB-KODI-SUPPORT-FILES as a start for your Kodi favourites. Note: requires a Kodi restart to load.

### <font color="red">Deprecated</font> - 3rd Party Addons that are lightly or no longer supported or available by other Repos

<b><u>Tommhe14 - 3rd Party Video Addons via Wrapper Repository</u></b> <br>

TV and Video functionality from https://tommhe14.github.io/ are some Video Addons<br>
- With the passing of Chris (aka cMaN) <i>Daddylive and The Crew</i> have limited support <br>
<b><font color="red">Important: </font>Patience is a Virtue</b> - These <b>Maneflix and ManeTV</b> Video Addons support thousands of links that automatically update.<br>
The servers can get overloaded so refreshing can give intermittent results. As such, you may need to be "patient" and at times wait several seconds for lists to be generated.

If it fails to generate a list or call up your link - simply try again and eventually it works. If nothing appears - Just refresh and try again to obtain your desired link or list. <br>
- Once you obtain a "good" or "working" link you should "Save to Favourites" - epecially for Live TV links. <br>

<b><font color="red">Warning: ManeTV and ManeFlix ate currently down! It appears that Tommhe14 wants to <b><i>monetize</i></b> his addon and therefore is no longer recommended for use!</font></b> <br>

Latest Version of the <b>Maneflix</b> Video Addon <br>
